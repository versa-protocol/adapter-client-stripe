## Environment

You can view an example "env" file in the root of this repository. In production, you'll set each of these variables on the deployed Docker image 

```bash
 # Your Versa client ID 
CLIENT_ID=versa_cid_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Your Versa client secret, which authenticates requests to the registry â€” note this should never be sent to a receiver!
CLIENT_SECRET=versa_csk_test_xxxxxxxxxx 

# A webhook secret issued by Stripe, which is used to verify the authenticity of incoming webhook events
WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# The URL of the Versa registry, where the client will register data hashes and decryption keys
REGISTRY_URL=https://registry.versa.org
```

## Testing the Docker Image Locally

```sh
docker run --env  CLIENT_ID=versa_cid_test_xxxxx --env CLIENT_SECRET=versa_csk_test_xxxxx --env WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx --env REGISTRY_URL=https://registry.versa.org [DOCKER_IMAGE]
